#+TITLE: Tests in Exercise 1 of Chapter 3

So finally I decided to run some tests for this exercise, as it was
asked in the book.  It was not easy to find how to generated a sorted
array of a given size, nor to find how to calculate how long something
takes.

So, I generated arrays of a given size, the size of the array was
equal to the maximum possible element in the array.  And for each size
I ran 200 tests, as it can be seen in the source cose (it's not that
complicated, it's defined with ~#define~'s.

So, I have two procedures:
 * ~bs1~, which makes only one comparison per cycle
 * ~bs2~, which makes two comparisons, but has the possibility to no
   run until the end.

So which one would win?

These are the results:

#+PLOT: ind:1 set:"xrange [10:100000]" set:"logscale x"
| SZ,MAX |   bs1 |  bs2 |
|--------+-------+------|
|     10 |  11.7 | 10.6 |
|    100 |  25.3 | 21.4 |
|   1000 | 103.8 | 33.1 |
|  10000 | 160.3 | 48.6 |
| 100000 | 282.7 | 68.4 |

So ok, for some reason this bs1 thing doesn't work as expected...  It
must be that it always goes until the end and perhaps has a little bit
more of operations inside of it...
