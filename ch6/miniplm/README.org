#+TITLE: miniplm language for K&R C book

* Overview

This little program is a draft before doing the exercise 6.2, which requires
writing of a C parser.  For this exercise I created a minimal version of the
PL/M language.  The result is something between PL/M and PL/0.  The syntax
is close to PL/M, but the size of the grammar is closer to PL/0.

* To Be Done
 * TODO test the grammar with logical expressions, update test files
 * TODO write an interpreter
 * TODO generate code (machine code, asm...)
